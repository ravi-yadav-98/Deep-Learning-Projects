# ResNet.py
'''
First introduced by He et al. in their 2015 paper, Deep Residual Learning for
Image Recognition [24], the ResNet architecture has become a seminal work, demonstrating
that extremely deep networks can be trained using standard SGD and a reasonable
initialization function. In order to train networks at depths greater than 50-100
(and in some cases, 1,000) layers, ResNet relies on a micro-architecture called the residual module.

Another interesting component of ResNet is that pooling layers are used
extremely sparingly. Building on the work of Springenberg et al.,
ResNet does not strictly rely on max pooling operations to reduce volume size.
Instead, convolutions with strides > 1 are used to not only learn
weights, but reduce the output volume spatial dimensions. In fact, there are only
two occurrences of pooling being applied in the full implementation of the architecture:

    1. The first (and only) currency of max pooling happens early in the network
    to help reduce spatial dimensions.

    2. The second pooling operation is actually an average pooling layer
    used in place of fully- connected layers, like in GoogLeNet.

Strictly speaking, there is only one max pooling layer â€“ all other reductions in spatial
dimensions are handled by convolutional layers.
