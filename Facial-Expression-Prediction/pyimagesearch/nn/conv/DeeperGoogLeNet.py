'''
There are only two primary differences between our implementation and the full
GoogLeNet architecture used by Szegedy et al. when training the network on the complete ImageNet dataset:

    1. Instead of using 7×7 filters with a stride of 2×2 in the first CONV layer, we use
    5×5 filters with a 1 × 1 stride. We use these due to the fact that our implementation
    of GoogLeNet is only able to accept 64 × 64 × 3 input images while the original
    implementation was constructed to accept 224 × 224 × 3 images. If we applied
    7 × 7 filters with a 2 × 2 stride, we would reduce our input dimensions too quickly.

    2. Our implementation is slightly shallower with two fewer Inception modules –
    in the original Szegedy et al. paper, two more Inception modules were added prior to the average pooling operation.
